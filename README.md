# KumuluzEE Node.js Config and Discovery sample

This module contains two services that will introduce you to KumuluzEE Node.js Config and Discovery library using Consul and etcd:

*  [`discovery-config-register`](http://github.com/nejcsm/kumuluzee-nodejs-discovery-sample/discovery-config-register)  microservice that sets custom configuration properties and registers itself to Consul or etcd,
*   [`discovery-discover`](http://github.com/nejcsm/kumuluzee-nodejs-discovery-sample/discovery-discover)  microservice that discovers and calls  `discovery-config-register` microservice.
